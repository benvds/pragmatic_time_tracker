# Feature Specification: Time Entry Display Logbook

**Feature Branch**: `000-logbook-feature`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Implemented (Retroactive Spec)  
**Input**: User description: "Display historical time tracking entries in a readable table format for reviewing work patterns"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Display historical time entries in table format
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: time entries, historical data, table display, work review
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clarified through implementation analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: viewing historical time entries
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement derived from actual implementation
6. Identify Key Entities (LogEntry with date, duration, description)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec matches implemented functionality
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec matches implementation)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a time tracker user, I want to view my historical time entries in a clear, organized table so I can review my work patterns, track productivity, and understand how I spend my working hours across different tasks and projects.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the time tracker application, **When** I navigate to the logbook page, **Then** I see a table with columns for Date, Duration, and Description
2. **Given** I have logged time entries for working days, **When** I view the logbook, **Then** entries are displayed in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
3. **Given** I have time entries with varying durations, **When** I view the logbook, **Then** durations are displayed in human-readable format (e.g., "2h 30m", "45m", "8h")
4. **Given** some of my time entries have no description, **When** I view the logbook, **Then** empty descriptions show as an em dash (‚Äî) for visual consistency
5. **Given** I am viewing the current month's entries, **When** I see the date column, **Then** only working days (Monday-Friday) are included, excluding weekends
6. **Given** I am viewing entries for the current month, **When** I look at the data, **Then** today's date is excluded (reserved for active time entry)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no time entries for the current month? (Table shows headers with empty body)
- How does system handle entries with special characters in descriptions? (Safely renders without HTML injection)
- What happens when there are many entries in a month? (All entries display in scrollable table)
- How does the system handle very long descriptions? (Text wraps appropriately within table cells)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display time entries in a structured table with Date, Duration, and Description columns
- **FR-002**: System MUST show entries in reverse chronological order (most recent first)  
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter entries to show only working days (Monday through Friday), excluding weekends
- **FR-004**: System MUST display durations in human-readable format combining hours and minutes
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle missing descriptions by displaying an em dash (‚Äî) for visual consistency
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate historical entries for the current month up to yesterday
- **FR-007**: System MUST exclude the current day from historical display
- **FR-008**: System MUST apply alternating row styling (striped) and hover effects for better readability
- **FR-009**: System MUST use semantic HTML table structure for accessibility and screen readers
- **FR-010**: System MUST safely render user-provided descriptions without HTML injection vulnerabilities
- **FR-011**: System MUST display dates in abbreviated month and day format (e.g., "Sep 26")
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle empty state gracefully when no entries exist

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Page MUST load and render within 5 seconds
- **NFR-002**: Table MUST be responsive and accessible on different screen sizes
- **NFR-003**: System MUST support keyboard navigation for accessibility
- **NFR-004**: Visual design MUST be consistent with application's overall styling

### Key Entities

- **LogEntry**: Represents a single time tracking record with unique identifier (UUID), date timestamp, duration in minutes, and optional description text
- **WorkingDay**: Represents a valid business day (Monday-Friday) within the current calendar month
- **Duration**: Time representation that can be formatted for human readability (hours and minutes display)
- **LogbookView**: The display container that manages the presentation of multiple LogEntry records
