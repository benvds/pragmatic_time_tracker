# Storage

The storage module is responsible for managing the persistence of data in the application. It uses a local first storage system.

The library to use is [LiveStore](https://docs.livestore.dev/getting-started/react-web/).

Update the test and seed data to use LiveStore. Add infrastructure to support seeding an initial set of data for both testing and development.
