# Feature Specification: Daily Time Tracking for Freelance Developer

**Feature Branch**: `001-as-a-freelance`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "as a freelance developer i want to track how many hours i worked daily. i track the hours and minutes per day, optionally a registration can have a short description. client or project tracking is unnecessary as i work months for the same client."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If total time lower than 7 hours: ERROR "Description required when tracking hours lower than 7 hours."
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a freelance developer working long-term for a single client, I need to track my daily work hours and minutes with optional descriptions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I worked today, **When** I record 8 hours and 30 minutes with description "Backend API development", **Then** the entry is saved for today's date
2. **Given** I worked today, **When** I record 5 hours without a description, **Then** a notification is shown that the description is required when time is below 7 hours.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to enter negative hours or minutes?
   ‚Üí negative hours or minutes are not allowed
- How does the system handle entries that exceed 24 hours in a day?
   ‚Üí 24 hours is the maximum allowed per day
- What happens if I try to add multiple time entries for the same day?
   ‚Üí only one entry per day is allowed

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to record daily time worked in hours and minutes format
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to optionally add a short description to each time entry
- **FR-003**: System MUST associate each time entry with a specific date
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist all time entries for future retrieval
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate time input to prevent invalid values, max 24 hours per day, no negative time entries.
- **FR-009**: System MUST require a description when time is below 6 hours

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Time Entry**: Represents a single work session with date, hours, minutes, and optional description
